# Scope

This document defines the explicit scope of the Institutional Memory Model (IMM).

---

## IN Scope

- Epistemology (Claim, Fact, Decision separation)
- Provenance and traceability
- Conflict modeling
- Governance and write rules
- Interoperability mappings (schema.org, PROV-O)

---

## OUT of Scope

- User interfaces
- Storage implementations
- Authentication / authorization
- Machine learning models
- Policy enforcement engines

---

## Non-Goals

IMM does NOT attempt to:
- replace databases or APIs
- define execution runtimes
- solve trust or alignment automatically

It defines **structure and discipline**, not behavior.
